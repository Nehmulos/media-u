Roadmap:
-opimize auto rss:
    -setting to list torrents in the web-ui before downloading them
    -use QWaitConditions and QEventLoops for the rss thread
    -customizable filters to detect download candidates
    -auto-add feeds when watchstatus changes
-update MAL watch status
-library improvements:
    -start searches for specific directories and not just for all
    -start mal searches for specific shows and not just for all
    -start wallpaper searches for specific shows and not just for all
-alternative onlinedb anidb.net http://wiki.anidb.net/w/UDP_API_Definition
-option to list/unlist missing files
-page that lists missing files with the possebillity to delete them

Optional:
-generate thumbnails for each episode
-try konachan and yande.re before getting pics from gelbooru
-get percise metadata (not based on bytesize guesses) and save it for each moviefile
-list subtitleTracks & audiotrack names

Probably won't fix:
-make mplayer use the gpu of the raspberry pi
 alternative: fix omxplayers playbackerrors and horrific subtitles
 alternative: just import stuff and export symlinks with xbmc compatible names
-any raspberry pi support

Bugs:
-Some remaining false-positive results from MAL search, get better query compare
-some strings form MAL are not properly decoded with QUrl::fromPercentEncoding
