Roadmap:
-listen to nyaa rss feeds download torrents with `curl '(url)' --compressed`
-choose fansubber Ui on TVShowPage
-observe the filesystem using QFileSystemWatcher or whatever is new in qt5
-list subtitleTracks & audiotrack names
-use serversent events to tell pause, and other videoplayer events
-add shows to correct lists when received as serversent event
-try konachan and yande.re before getting pics from gelbooru
-continue watching random show button for html StartPage
-search nyaa for new episodes of favourite fansubber
-add new episodes to transmission-cli

Optional:
-generate thumbnails for each episode

Probably won't fix:
-make mplayer use the gpu of the raspberry pi
 alternative: fix omxplayers playbackerrors and horrific subtitles
 alternative: just import stuff and export symlinks with xbmc compatible names
-any raspberry pi support

Bugs:
-Some remaining false-positive results from MAL search, get better query compare
-some strings form MAL are not properly decoded with QUrl::fromPercentEncoding
