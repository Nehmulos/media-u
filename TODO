Roadmap:
-add search directories (via qt gui)
-use searchdirectories instead of fixed paths in main.cpp
-list subtitleTracks & audiotracks for show and select prefered track (multiling rips)
-seekbar that shows the progress of the video
-generate thumbnails with libavconv when hovering the seekbar (like youtube)
-generate thumbnails for each episode
-remember play status for files in library
-detect favourite fansubber: (check fs of last 2 eps if notEq check most used fs)
-search nyaa for new episodes of favourite fansubber
-add new episodes to transmission-cli

Probably won't fix:
-make mplayer use the gpu of the raspberry pi
 alternative: fix omxplayers playbackerrors and horrific subtitles
 alternative: just import stuff and export symlinks with xbmc compatible names
-any raspberry pi support

Bugs:
-Some remaining false-positive results from MAL search, get better query compare
-some strings form MAL are not properly decoded with QUrl::fromPercentEncoding
-fix border for background wallpapers;
