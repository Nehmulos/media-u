Roadmap:
-write a qt gui
-write a remote control gui
-start mplayer task and terminate it via the remote api
-download poster images from mal
-download wallpaper images form some other place
-compile it on a raspberry pi (only tested on 64bit desktop so far)

Bugs:
-some strings form MAL are not properly decoded with QUrl::formPercentEncoding
