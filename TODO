Roadmap:
-When status == waiting for new episodes add an NyaaRssListener to the show
    -listen to nyaa rss feeds download torrents with `curl '(url)' --compressed`
    -add new episodes to transmission-cli
-choose fansubber Ui on TVShowPage
-alternative onlinedb anidb.net http://wiki.anidb.net/w/UDP_API_Definition

Optional:
-generate thumbnails for each episode
-try konachan and yande.re before getting pics from gelbooru
-get percise metadata (not based on bytesize guesses) and save it for each moviefile
-list subtitleTracks & audiotrack names

Probably won't fix:
-make mplayer use the gpu of the raspberry pi
 alternative: fix omxplayers playbackerrors and horrific subtitles
 alternative: just import stuff and export symlinks with xbmc compatible names
-any raspberry pi support

Bugs:
-Some remaining false-positive results from MAL search, get better query compare
-some strings form MAL are not properly decoded with QUrl::fromPercentEncoding
