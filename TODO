BUGS:
-Some unreproducable crash during Onlinesync where it enters an endless event spawning loop and runs oom

Roadmap:
-get rid of the rss autodownload and put it into a different program, provide an API to get the watchlist instead
-library improvements:
    -start searches for specific directories and not just for all
-isMovie check for TvShow, try episode name on mal-search if isMovie or name + "movie"
-add mpv api via libmpv.
     It's not stable yet, so I'm going to wait with this.
     It appears like they deprecated --slave mode

-webui: create-gif settings & crop

REFACTOR/rethink
-stop using so many threads for networking it's retarded, also OnlineSync has an unreproducable crash
-deleting missing files via MissingFilesPage would probably be insecure, due to fucked up cross-thread references

Optional:
-try konachan and yande.re before getting pics from gelbooru
-list subtitleTracks & audiotrack names (maybe on hovering the input-ui)

Stalled:
-alternative onlinedb anidb.net http://wiki.anidb.net/w/UDP_API_Definition
-some way to switch between different files of the same subgroup
-The MAL API is a complete mess, but I can't fix their API and my forum posts didn't do anything. Use anilist.co instead
