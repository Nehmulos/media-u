Roadmap:
-opimize auto rss:
    -list torrents in the web-ui before downloading them
    -use QWaitConditions and QEventLoops for the rss thread
    -auto-add feeds when watchstatus changes
    -get prefered resolution for subgroup to download
-library improvements:
    -start searches for specific directories and not just for all
    -start mal searches for specific shows and not just for all
    -start wallpaper searches for specific shows and not just for all
-alternative onlinedb anidb.net http://wiki.anidb.net/w/UDP_API_Definition

-some way to switch between different files of the same subgroup
-isMovie check for TvShow, try episode name on mal-search if isMovie or name + "movie"

-webui: notification & links bar fixed on top
-webui: options page
-webui: rss search results overlay
-webui: create-gif settings & crop
-webui: option to list/unlist missing files
-webui: page that lists missing files with the possebillity to delete them

Optional:
-generate thumbnails for each episode
-try konachan and yande.re before getting pics from gelbooru
-get percise metadata (not based on bytesize guesses) and save it for each moviefile
-list subtitleTracks & audiotrack names

Probably won't fix:
-make mplayer use the gpu of the raspberry pi
 alternative: fix omxplayers playbackerrors and horrific subtitles
 alternative: just import stuff and export symlinks with xbmc compatible names
-any raspberry pi support

Bugs:
-Some remaining false-positive results from MAL search, get better query compare
-some strings form MAL are not properly decoded with QUrl::fromPercentEncoding
