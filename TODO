Roadmap:
-write a episode listing for remote
-start mplayer task with args "-ass -embeddedfonts -fs"
-pause, fwd, quit, via remote
-remember play status for files in library
-fix wallpaper download (thread delete&flow probably messed up)
-compile it on a raspberry pi (only tested on 64bit desktop so far)

Bugs:
-Some remaining false-positive results from MAL search, get better query compare
-some strings form MAL are not properly decoded with QUrl::fromPercentEncoding
